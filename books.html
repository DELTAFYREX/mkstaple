          <p>Writing the first book, <strong>The Holiday Killers</strong> was an adventure and a leap of faith in using my imagination to write a book about a subject that I had limited knowledge from a life perspective! This was my first step into the unknown world of publishing, the internet and the public world! To put yourself out there was a bold move on my part. I was not really sure that I could do it!!! I started The <strong>Holiday Killers</strong> in the dark when <strong>Hurricane Igor</strong> struck <strong>Newfoundland in September 2010.</strong> The main characters <strong>John Lee Harris</strong> and <strong>Roy Wade Boone</strong> coming to life by the time the power came back! Both young men came from dysfunctional families and become horrific serial killers who terrorize <strong>Maine, USA</strong> and kill for the fun of it around holiday times!</p> 
          <br><p>Writing the second book, <strong>Legacy of Evil,</strong> flowed so easily from the first book and I wasn’t really concerned anymore what the world thought of my writing! I did it because I could!! <strong>Dana Elliott’s</strong> fate was sealed when she met <strong>John Lee Harris</strong> and <strong>Roy Wade Boone.</strong> Her twin children <strong>Devon and Darla</strong> would never be able to survive their <strong>Legacy of Evil!</strong></p>
          <br><p>The third novel, <strong>the Squatters</strong>, came to me  when my husband Mark and I visited <strong>Nashville, Gatlinburg</strong> and <strong>Pigeon Forge</strong> and I saw the beautiful scenery and people of <strong>Tennessee.</strong> I could imagine <strong>Judas George</strong> and <strong>Lara Whitey</strong> and what it was like to grow up in the <strong>Smoky Mountains</strong> and sometimes struggle to survive. I remember writing much of <strong>The Squatters</strong> while we were there. Not knowing how my book would turn out, it was only when we returned home that my husband challenged me to write a book with a happy ending. It was then that <strong>The Squatters</strong> came alive!!</p>
          <br><p>My fourth novel <strong>Murder at Blackhead</strong> was inspired by many conservations I had with my Mother-in-Law who was supposed to attend the Christmas dance at the <strong>Knights of Columbus</strong> in <strong>St. John's, Newfoundland</strong> on a very cold and wintery night on <strong>December 12, 1942.</strong> She missed the dance and told me of the horror that <strong>St. John's</strong> faced when 99 servicemen and women died on that cold <strong>December</strong> night. Its historical fiction with the fire having been set by the <strong>Nazi's</strong> to disrupt the supply line between <strong>North America</strong> and <strong>Europe</strong> with a murder mystery thrown in. </p>
